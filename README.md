# fork of BalatroMobileCompat

what did i change?
- replace balatro's keyboard with the android keyboard
- turn on luajit? (not sure if it's a bad idea)

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) in order to work.

Patches were taken from [balatro-mobile-builder](https://github.com/PGgamer2/balatro-mobile-builder), so check that for more information on what they do.
